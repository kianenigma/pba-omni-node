//! Hardcoded assumptions of this omni-node.
//!
//! Consensus: This template uses [`sc-manual-seal`] consensus and therefore has no expectation of
//! the runtime having any consensus-related pallets. The block time of the node can easily be
//! adjusted by [`crate::cli::Cli::consensus`]
//!
//! RPC: This node exposes only [`substrate_frame_rpc_system`] as additional RPC endpoints from the
//! runtime.
